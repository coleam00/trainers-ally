Create the workout for day {day} out of {workouts_in_week}. This is phase {phase}. The workout needs to have a warm up, balance + core portion, strength portion, and cooldown (static stretching and cardio).
The workout should be around {workout_length}. You decide the number of exercises for each portion and determine the reps/time. Whether it is reps or time is obviously
based on the exercise. For example, cardio like running is time, exercises like push ups are reps, etc. Estimate how long reps + breaks between sets will take
to determine the length of the workout.

Details for each section of the workout (This is phase {phase}):

Warm up:
  - Include 10 minutes of cardio
  - Include static stretches and dynamic stretches
  - Limit rep based exercises to 1 set of 15 instead of something like 3 sets of 10

Balance + core portion:
  - Include 1 balance exercise and 2 core exercises
  - Do not repeat exercises here that are in the balance + core portion of other days already made
  - If this is phase 1 - focus on stabalization endurance
  - If this is phase 2 - focus on strength endurance
  - If this is phase 3 - focus on muscular development

Strength portion:
  - Do not repeat exercises here that are in the strength portion of other days already made
  - If this is phase 1 - focus on lower weight and form of movements along with stabalization. Include these 5 movement patterns: squat, hinge, push, press, pull. Every day has to include all 5. Don't include difficult exercises like overhead squats.
  - If this is phase 2 - start progressing in both weight and reps. Instead of full body like phase 1, each day needs to include a movement that works legs, chest, back, and shoulders.
  - If this is phase 3 - switch between days that works chest, back, and shoulders, and days that works triceps, biceps, and legs. Because it's more split up, include a couple workouts for each body area.

Cooldown:
  - Include 5-10 minutes of cardio gradually reducing speed
  - Include a few static stretches that relate to the muscles used in the strength portion

Here is some extra criteria that needs to be followed when creating the workout:\n\n {extra_criteria} \n\n

Here are the workouts you already created for previous days in the week. This will be empty if you are creating the first workout of the week.
Your goal is to have a wide range of workouts, so do not repeat exercises, especially for the balance + core and strength portions.
Never include an exercise/movement in the workout you create that is in the previous two days under any circumstances.
And just because you slightly vary an exercise doesn't mean it is different. For example, Incline dumbbell chest press and Incline dumbbell chest press with rotation
are the same exercise. So you would NOT have Incline dumbbell chest press on one day and then Incline dumbbell chest press with rotation on the next day.
Same thing with Front rack lunges (with barbell) and Front rack lunges (with dumbell). Those are also the same exercise so don't include both on different days.
The workouts need to be very different than each other (not just slight variations) to have good variety.

Here are the details of the client: \n\n {client_info} \n\n
